# Universal Linear Regression Model(MATLAB)
I have tried fitting the given data points to the polynomial of any given order without using object-oriented programming in MATLAB.
The inputs are going to be X and Y coordinates of the data points and the order of the polynomial to which the data is fiited.
The output is a plot along with the equation of the polynomial.
Please ignore the comments.
